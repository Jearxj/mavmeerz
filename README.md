## Installation


##Heroku:

### Quick Start

Clone from GitHub, then run

  >npm install

to install your dependency packages.

Gulp instructions here:
> gulp babel
* manually compiled all .jsx files in the components folder into .js files. Pipes them into compiled/components
* REMEMBER YOU ARE USING REACT AND NEED TO COMPILE YOUR .JSX FILES OR ELSE NONE OF YOUR CHANGES WILL rendering
> gulp watch
* Use to monitor your .jsx files for changes and automatically compile them into .js files.
* We never properly configured gulp watch to restart upon breaks, so you'll need to monitor your terminal from
time to time to make sure gulp watch is still running.
> gulp heroku
* pushes to heroku. Won't work out of the box, you need to configure your heroku locally first.
> gulp webpack
* Runs webpack.

Local testing here:

  >node server/server.js

  or

  >nodemon server/server.js

  Then navigate to your localhost, and enjoy yourself.
